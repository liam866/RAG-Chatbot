# Supplements and Gym Basics

## Do I need protein shakes?
Protein shakes are just a convenient way to get more protein. They aren't "magic." If you can get enough protein from regular food like meat, eggs, or lentils, you don't need shakes at all.

## What does Creatine do?
Creatine is a very common supplement that helps your muscles produce energy during short bursts of heavy lifting. It can help you get one or two extra reps in, which leads to better progress over time.

## Are "fat burners" worth the money?
Most fat burners are just expensive caffeine pills. They might give you a small energy boost, but they won't burn fat on their own. A good diet and consistent exercise are much more effective.

## Should I take a pre-workout drink?
Pre-workout drinks usually contain caffeine to help you feel energized. They can be helpful if you are tired, but they aren't necessary. A cup of coffee or a small snack can often do the same thing.

## What are the most important supplements for a beginner?
For most people, no supplements are "required." Focus on good food and sleep first. If you want to try something, a basic protein powder or a multivitamin are usually the best places to start.
