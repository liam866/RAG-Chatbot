# Recovery and Rest

## Why do my muscles feel sore a day after the gym?
This is called "delayed onset muscle soreness." It’s a normal sign that your body is adapting to new movements. Gentle movement, like a walk, and staying hydrated can help ease the tightness.

## How many hours of sleep do I need?
Sleep is when your body actually changes and gets stronger. Aim for 7 to 9 hours. If you don't sleep enough, your body won't be able to repair the muscles you worked on during the day.

## What is a "rest day" and do I need them?
A rest day is a day where you don't do a hard workout. These are essential. Your muscles don't grow while you are at the gym; they grow while you are resting and recovering from the gym.

## Can I workout if I'm still a little sore?
If the soreness is light, a workout can actually help by getting blood to the muscles. However, if the pain is sharp or so bad that you can’t move properly, it is better to take an extra rest day.

## What is a "deload" week?
Every couple of months, it’s a good idea to have a week where you lift much lighter weights or do fewer sets. This gives your joints and nervous system a chance to fully recover so you can come back even stronger.
