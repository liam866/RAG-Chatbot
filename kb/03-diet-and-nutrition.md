# Diet and Nutrition

## How much protein do I really need?
A simple goal is to aim for a portion of protein—like chicken, fish, beans, or eggs—with every meal. Protein is the main building block your body uses to fix the muscles you work out in the gym.

## Should I stop eating carbs to get fit?
No. Carbs give your brain and muscles the energy they need to work hard. Instead of cutting them out, focus on "slow" carbs like oats, brown rice, and potatoes, which give you steady energy throughout the day.

## What should I eat before a workout?
Try to eat a light meal with some carbs about 1 to 2 hours before you train. A piece of fruit or a slice of toast can give you the quick energy boost you need to get through your session.

## Does it matter what I eat after the gym?
Yes. After working out, your body is ready to soak up nutrients. Aim for a meal with both protein and carbs within an hour or two of finishing to help your muscles start the repair process.

## How much water should I drink?
You should aim for enough water so that your urine is mostly clear. If you are sweating a lot at the gym, try to drink a bit extra during and after your workout to avoid feeling tired or getting headaches.
