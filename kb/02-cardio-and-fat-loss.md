# Cardio and Losing Weight

## Should I do cardio before or after weights?
If your main goal is to get stronger, do your cardio after weights. This ensures you have the most energy for lifting. If you do cardio first, you might be too tired to lift with good form.

## What is the best type of cardio for fat loss?
The "best" cardio is the one you actually enjoy and will stick to. Walking on an incline, cycling, and using the elliptical are all great low-impact ways to burn calories without wearing out your joints.



## Do I have to do cardio to lose weight?
Cardio is a great tool to help burn extra energy, but weight loss mainly comes from your diet. You can lose weight without cardio, but adding it in helps your heart health and lets you eat a bit more while still losing fat.

## How long should my cardio sessions be?
For general fitness, 20 to 30 minutes of steady movement is a great start. If you are short on time, 10 to 15 minutes of faster, more intense work can also be very effective.

## Why is the scale not moving even though I'm working out?
Muscle is denser than fat. You might be losing fat and building muscle at the same time. Instead of just checking the scale, look at how your clothes fit or take progress photos to see the real changes.
