# Gym Routine and Lifting

## How many days a week should I go to the gym?
For most people starting out, 3 to 4 days a week is the sweet spot. This allows you to work all your major muscles while still having enough days off for your body to recover and grow.

## Should I do the same exercises every day?
No. It is better to follow a plan that hits different muscles on different days, or a full-body plan with rest days in between. Muscles need about 48 hours to recover after a hard session before you train them again.

## How do I know how much weight to pick?
Choose a weight that feels heavy by the last few reps, but not so heavy that your form gets sloppy. If you can do 12 reps easily, the weight is too light. If you can’t get to 5 reps, it is likely too heavy.

## What are "sets" and "reps"?
A "rep" (repetition) is one complete motion of an exercise. A "set" is a group of those reps. For example, "3 sets of 10 reps" means you do the movement 10 times, rest, and repeat that whole process 3 times.

## Should I lift weights or use machines?
Both are good. Machines are great for beginners because they guide your movement and are very safe. Free weights (dumbbells and barbells) are excellent for building balance and using more muscles at once. A mix of both is usually best.
